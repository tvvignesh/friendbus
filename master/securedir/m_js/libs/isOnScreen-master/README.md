jQuery.isOnScreen
==========

Simple jQuery plugin to determine if an element is within the viewport.  Optional parameters allow the user to specify a minimum percentage of the element's dimensions that must be visible to qualify.

@param `x` - float values to test against, as a decimal value of how much of the element's width must be visible for the method to return true.  defaults to 1 (100%)

@param `y` - float values to test against, as a decimal value of how much of the element's height must be visible for the method to return true.  defaults to 1 (100%)

For example, passing `$(element).isOnScreen(0.5, 0.5)` would return `true` if the element had at least 50% of itâ€™s height and width within the viewport rectangle. `$(element).isOnScreen(0.1, 0.5)` would return `true` if at least 10% of the width were visible *and* 50% of the height were visible. Omitting an argument (or passing `null`) defaults to 1 (or 100%).

Usage is simple

    $('selector').isOnScreen();  // returns true if element is entirely within the viewport
    $('selector').isOnScreen(0.5, 0.5); // returns true if element is at least 50% within the viewport
