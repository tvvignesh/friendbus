# friendbus
A full fledged social networking website made for my old startup - No longer maintained

I made this project and then realized I made a lot of mistakes. This does not use any framework nor does it follows any standards. The codebase is written from scratch.

# It is made in:
HTML
CSS
Javascript
PHP
MySQL
Bootstrap
JQuery

and few more libraries like FFMpeg, etc..

I dont have time to write documentation for this right now. So, please try to figure it out yourself. You can file issues in case you have any questions and I will see if I can help.
